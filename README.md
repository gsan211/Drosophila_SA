# Drosophila_SA
calculate pi around drosophila sexually antagonistic alleles

Scripts for comparing diversity around putative sexually antagonistic alleles in the drosophila DPGP3 dataset

One script calculate diversity around SA alleles

Other script scrambles assignment of genotypes around SA alleles to generate a null distribute of diversity differences between male benefit/female benefit SA alleles
